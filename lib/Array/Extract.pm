=head1 NAME

Array::Extract - extract element from an array

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::Extract qw(extract);

  # remove those members from @members who are
  # blackballed and store them in @banner
  my @banned = extract { $_->blackballed } @members;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Function to extract elements from an array that match
a block.

=head2 Function

The function is exported on demand

=over

=item extract BLOCK ARRAY

Removes elements from the ARRAY that match the
block and returns them.

  # leave just the even numbers in @numbers
  my @numbers = (1..100);
  my @odds = extract { $_ % 2 } @numbers;

Care is taken to do the least number of splice
operations as possible (which can be important when
the array is a tied object with a class such as
Tie::File)

sub extract(&\@) {
  my $block = shift;
  my $array = shift;

  # loop invarients.  The element we're currently on
  # and the length of the array
  my $i = 0;
  my $length = @{ $array };

  # the index we started removing from
  my $remove_from;

  # what we've collected to return
  my @return;

  # for each element of the array
  while ($i < $length) {
    local $_ = $array->[ $i ];
    if (!$block->()) {
      # this content we keep
      if (defined $remove_from) {
        # but first we need to remove the stuff we wanted
        # to extract from the list
        my $number = $i - $remove_from;
        $i -= $number;
        $length -= $number;
        splice @{$array}, $remove_from, $number;
        undef $remove_from;
      }
    } else {
      # remmebr we're going to remove this content
      $remove_from = $i
        unless defined $remove_from;

      # remember the content we were going to keep
      push @return, $_;
    }
    $i++;
  }

  # remove any thing at the end of the list that we were still removing
  splice @{$array}, $remove_from, $i - $remove_from if defined $remove_from;
  return @return;
}
